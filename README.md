outline_app started as a scratch pad for a Flutter application. It has evolved into a National Park Trails app providing a curated list of the top 7 trails for each park.

Features of note at this time include:
  - dark/light mode
  - persistent data for most recent park viewed and dark mode
    settings using shared preferences
  - SQFlite database storing park and trail data
  - Google map's static maps for trailheads
